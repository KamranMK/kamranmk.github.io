# Sequence tagging with Probabilistic Models

Basically sequence tagging is used in real-world use cases where for example we need to find named entities in a sentence (e.g. Person, City, Date) or find out parts of speeches (e.g. Verb, Noun, Adj, etc.).

There are various approaches to sequence labeling:
* Rule-based models (not covered in this course)
* Separate label classifiers for each taken (classification approachh)
* Sequence models (HMM, MEMM, CRF) - topic of this lecture
* Neural Networks
